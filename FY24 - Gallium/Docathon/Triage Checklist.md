AMER - [Triage Qs Oct 2023](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/flkelly_microsoft_com/ERIF9O5OOQ1PsXRky_6Ql80Bjl8uUH227umqx8aQKrnKSw?e=uWhbyu)

## Why?

Concern:

We are now a global team and we should have a global approach to allow work to be moved around if needed, for example - capacity
## Findings

### AMER and EMEA (common)

1. Number of Nodes
		AMER - target a minimum of 6 nodes, EMEA has no specific
1. Is there a landing zone in place
		EMEA makes mention of the ESLZ and the principles within this LZ
1. Which region(s) is the customer looking to use?
		HA / BCDR should be addressed and captured here as well
		Number of regions - stretched (HA) or dedicated / DR region
		EMEA makes mention of supporting services and their availability within the region
		AMER makes mentions of the HCX constraint of 150ms
1. Has an application assessment been completed?
2. Partner involved?
3. Skill level of partner / customer
4. Does the customer have Azure Cloud Experience?

### EMEA Only

1. Asks about quota and if subscription has been allow-listed
2. Pilot or POC completed prior to production deployment?
3. Migration approach and constraints?
4. Use of MoN?
5. Specific FastTrack for Azure Asks?
6. VMware specifics

### AMER only

1. Specific callout with regards to language (EMEA only offers English)
2. Has the customer completed a cost analysis / Why AVS and NOT Azure Native (EMEA confirms this as part of technical scoping - might be better to confirm earlier - save some cycles?)
3. When does customer want to start moving workloads?
4. Is there a dedicated Project Manager?
5. Required start and end dates? (Should this not be captured already as part of Scoping?)
6. Any roadblocks or dependant technologies?

## New Approach

1. Have a common scoping template used across all regions as a global team.
2. Use non technical English to capture as much information as quickly as possible
