Main Region: Denmark
5 countries migrated
Quite a mix of VMs
80% move ratio
1 or 2 over the 1000 limit

Customer is using Azure Migrate ONLY
- **Dr Migrate was mentioned**
- **Microsoft Solution Assessment was also suggested by MSFT team**
Been working with the customer for ISS
Headquarters in Denmark
Consolidated from all countries into Azure - Lift and Shift Method

Tool used:
ALZ Accelerator

Customer used a partner:
**Partner** was doing a manual assessment after communicating with Application Team
- Reaching out to each application team was a challenge
- Manual assessment was removed from the process

**Migration Approach was slow**
**Partner was working quite slowly**

CMF was suggested by the account team
- Complexity about introducing another partner
- Partner being used by CMF (Mindtree) - was the existing partner
- Changes from the customer - might be looking at CMF now

Customer/general feedback:
**Not a migration TOOL issue**
**Was a process / stakeholder management**
**Migration team was a central team**
**Lots of approval processes was slowing down the process**
==Dependency mapping was a real challenge - needs to be deployed manually==
- ==Can we build dependency mapping into Azure Migrate itself==
How does the customer's operation team take over after migration
- Can the Azure Migrate tool provide some post migration information
- CMDB type report
- ==Base recommendations - how can I change from migration to Management==

Next phases of the Migration:
- Azure Migrate
- Dr Migrate
- Microsoft Solution Assessment
